## Abstract

Python’s simplicity and productivity have made it a cornerstone of modern software development. However, its dynamic nature introduces runtime errors and performance constraints, limiting its use in high-reliability and high-performance applications. We present **PySafe**, a superset of Python that integrates advanced safety and optimization features while preserving Python’s ease of use. PySafe introduces a borrow checker for memory safety, contracts for behavior specification, strict typing for error prevention, enhanced tuples for structured data, a prover for formal verification, and compilation to LLVM IR via SSA for performance. This paper outlines PySafe’s syntax and semantics, describes its implementation, and demonstrates its advantages through examples, offering a robust extension to Python for critical systems.

## 1. Introduction

Python’s popularity stems from its readable syntax, extensive libraries, and dynamic flexibility. Yet, this dynamism leads to challenges: runtime type errors, memory misuse, and suboptimal performance in computation-heavy tasks. These issues restrict Python’s suitability for domains like systems programming, safety-critical software, and high-performance computing.

**PySafe** addresses these limitations by extending Python with:
- **Borrow Checker:** Ensures memory safety by managing resource ownership and borrowing.
- **Contracts:** Define preconditions, postconditions, and invariants for verification.
- **Strict Typing:** Enforces type safety with mandatory annotations and inference.
- **Enhanced Tuples:** Add named fields and pattern matching to tuples.
- **Prover:** Supports formal verification of program properties.
- **LLVM IR Compilation via SSA:** Optimizes performance through native code generation.

PySafe maintains compatibility with existing Python code, allowing gradual adoption of its features.

This paper contributes:
- A Python-compatible language with safety and performance enhancements.
- A detailed design of its syntax and semantics.
- An implementation strategy for its compiler.
- Illustrative use cases highlighting its benefits.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 surveys related work, Section 3 details the language design, Section 4 explains the implementation, Section 5 provides evaluation scenarios, and Section 6 discusses future work.

## 2. Related Work

PySafe draws inspiration from multiple languages and tools:
- **Rust:** Pioneered borrow checking for memory safety without garbage collection [1].
- **Eiffel:** Introduced design by contract with formal specifications [2].
- **mypy:** Provides static type checking for Python via optional annotations [3].
- **Dafny:** Combines contracts and formal verification with a prover [4].
- **Numba:** Uses LLVM to JIT-compile Python for performance [5].
- **Cython:** Adds static typing to Python for speed [6].
- **PyPy:** A JIT-compiled Python implementation [7].
- **Mojo:** A Python superset by Modular with borrow checking and optimizations [8].

**PySafe** uniquely integrates these concepts into a cohesive, Python-compatible framework.

## 3. Language Design

### 3.1 Borrow Checker

Inspired by Rust, PySafe’s borrow checker ensures memory safety using own and borrow annotations:

```python
def transfer(a: borrow int, b: own int) -> int:
    return a + b  # 'a' is immutable; 'b' is owned
```

It prevents data races and invalid accesses, adapting Rust’s model to Python’s reference semantics.

### 3.2 Contracts

Contracts use decorators to specify behavior:

```python
@pre(lambda self: self.balance >= 0)
@post(lambda self, result: self.balance == old(self).balance - result)
def withdraw(self, amount: int) -> int:
    self.balance -= amount
    return amount
```

Here, `@pre` and `@post` define conditions, with `old` referencing the pre-execution state, and can be enforced at runtime or checked statically.

### 3.3 Strict Typing

PySafe requires type annotations, with inference reducing verbosity:

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

This catches type errors at compile time, thereby improving reliability.

### 3.4 Enhanced Tuples

Tuples gain named fields and pattern matching:

```python
point = (x=10, y=20)
print(point.x)  # Outputs 10
```

This enhances data structuring compared to Python’s basic tuples.

### 3.5 Prover Integration

The `@prove` decorator enables formal verification:

```python
@prove("forall x in range(10): x >= 0")
def positive_numbers() -> List[int]:
    return [i for i in range(10)]
```

A prover (e.g., Z3) confirms that the specified properties hold.

### 3.6 Compilation to LLVM IR

PySafe compiles to LLVM IR using SSA form, optimizing performance through native code generation. Further details are provided in Section 4.

## 4. Implementation

The PySafe compiler operates through the following stages:
- **Parsing:** Uses a parser (for example, Ratpack) to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from PySafe code.
- **Type Checking:** Validates types using a Hindley-Milner-inspired system.
- **Borrow Checking:** Analyzes ownership and lifetimes to ensure memory safety.
- **Contract Checking:** Dynamically or statically validates specified contracts.
- **SSA Transformation:** Converts the AST into Static Single Assignment form for optimization.
- **LLVM IR Generation:** Produces optimized machine code via LLVM.

Optionally, a prover runs for functions with `@prove` annotations. Python interoperability is planned via an FFI or an embedded interpreter.

## 5. Evaluation

### 5.1 Memory Safety

The borrow checker prevents unsafe modifications. For example:

```python
lst: own List[int] = [1, 2, 3]
for x: borrow int in lst:
    # lst.append(4)  # This operation would be rejected by the borrow checker
    print(x)
```

### 5.2 Contract Verification

A banking system example:

```python
class Account:
    balance: int = 0

    @invariant(lambda self: self.balance >= 0)
    @post(lambda self, result: self.balance == old(self).balance + result)
    def deposit(self, amount: int) -> int:
        self.balance += amount
        return amount
```

The prover confirms that the class invariant holds.

### 5.3 Performance

A compiled matrix multiplication routine in PySafe could outperform Python’s native interpreted execution by leveraging LLVM optimizations.

## 6. Conclusion

PySafe enhances Python by integrating memory safety, formal verification, and performance features while maintaining Python's ease of use. Its design leverages modern compiler and verification technologies, offering a reliable and efficient framework for developing critical systems. Future efforts will refine PySafe’s syntax, improve interoperability, and empirically validate its advantages.
